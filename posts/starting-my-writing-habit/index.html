        <p>My new habit is starting to form and shape itself. I started the new year with a
few little habits I want to establish and one slowly kicks in. Originally I
intended to take 30 minutes every day to write: my thoughts on this blog,
comment on documents in the company and finish my own documents.</p>
<p>Until now I have mostly been the reading type of person. Back in school I&rsquo;ve
spent a significant amount of money on books about programming. This helped me
to get into the field. Since I moved into management I noticed a similar kind of
learning path: I again bought &ndash; and am still buying &ndash; books on management and
leadership. This seems to be my learning habit and my way of getting into a
specific topic.</p>
<p>However writing means to learn to express myself better and with more clarity.
Structuring my thoughts into well-crafted arguments allows me to think in more
detail and from a more diverse set of perspectives. My most recent example is a
blog post about migrating from a Monolith to Microservices. I&rsquo;ve been trying to
write this post for almost two months now. Several versions of it exist by now,
but it seems the post is still to rough to actually make sense.</p>
<p>Additionally I discovered, that writing those lines were almost like therapy for
me. I recently announced that I would be leaving my current company and in doing
so I wanted to write down what I would want to help my next gig with. Especially
on this topic as I have seen a migration that went south (at least in my
opinion). After I acknowledged my self therapy I started to wonder what my real
message is and re-wrote the whole post <em>again</em>. Now I&rsquo;m at a state where I think
I will simply delete the draft and start over. Mostly because during this
process I discovered two things: 1/ I don&rsquo;t really have anything new to add to
the discussion and 2/ this topic is really complex and one post does not do
credit to it.</p>
<p>But what does this story have to do with this post? It illustrates why at least
for me the process of writing helps me to lay out my arguments much better.
Before, most of those arguments were formed semi-spontaneously during a
conversation on the water-cooler. In result those were a lot more rough not only
on the edges. What I can slowly see happening is that my arguments become much
more sound and I feel much safer when sharing them.</p>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading Leadership is language by L. David Marquet, the same author of Turn the Ship Around. In this book, Marquet describes the different ways people communicate and how it influences the outcomes we get. This should not be any news really, but the book explains in much more detail how this happens. Especially when there is a power dynamic between the participants of a conversation or meeting.
The main theme across the book is the sinking of a ship called El Faro caused by a hurricane.</description>

      <title>Monolith to Microservice</title>

      <description>Why is moving from a monolithic architecture to a microservices based one so hard? And is it worth it? Often those projects happen in organizations that were successful in the past and now enter a phase of scaling. This can be scaling by adding lots and lots of developers, or by allowing individual scaling of sub-components, because the system is screaming under load and is getting more and more expensive to run.</description>

      <description>In many organizations today there is one thing that almost always is true: there are too many things done in parallel, there is too much work-in-progress, everyone is busy but nothing gets done. If this is so ubiquitous why is no one doing anything about it? Are people not aware or do they not know how to fix it? This is so predominant, that it almost is too easy to just claim:</description>

      <title>Campaigns in Elasticsearch</title>
      <link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/search/campaigns-in-elasticsearch/</link>

      <description>In e-commerce search enabling dynamic prices or campaigns requires some attributes to be more volatile than others. A discount on Black Friday that is should only be valid between 7 PM and midnight. The flags that promote the discount. The teasers on product listings showing what products will be discounted, before the discount is in effect. Products that are only discounted for a certain customer group.
Traditionally this is solved by updating the documents in the search index.</description>

      <description>The date slowly approached and then it just happened. After almost four years I left Zalando end of March. I joined Zalando as Senior Engineer in the search team. In this role I helped migrate the search systems from the old monolith (Jimmy) to a microservice based architecture. In those times, microservices where meant literally and a lot of them were created.
The system was based on SolrCloud and basically a home-grown Kafka like messaging system based on SQS and DynamoDB.</description>

      <title>Aligning through writing documents</title>

      <description>Writing narratives and technical documents becomes a more and more relevant skill to have when navigating today&amp;rsquo;s organizations. Often times successful alignment between teams or even departments rely on this form of communication. Personally I have seen how I was unable to convey my thoughts and ideas to a wider audience simply because I was not able to write them down. Later I learned that only writing them down is not enough to form an alignment.</description>

      <description>My new habit is starting to form and shape itself. I started the new year with a few little habits I want to establish and my writing habit slowly kicks in. Originally I intended to take 30 minutes every day to write: my thoughts on this blog, comment on documents in the company and finish my own documents.
Until now I have mostly been the reading type of person. Back in school I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a significant amount of money on books about programming.</description>

      <title>Providing Difficult Feedback</title>

      <description>When moving from an individual contributor role into management, the biggest challenge for me was to provide difficult feedback. This might have been bigger for me compared to others as within a very short period of time a number of my colleagues and peers suddenly started to report to me. Looking back at 2019 overcoming this has been my biggest personal achievement.
What is ruinous empathy? One of the books I read in 2019 is Radical Candor, a &amp;ldquo;new management philosophy&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>About a year ago I transitioned into management. I changed my role from Senior Software Developer to Engineering Lead in Zalando. In this post I want to share my experience, good and bad, things that went well, where I screwed up and what I&amp;rsquo;m taking from it.
A difficult first year As my manager put it in my performance review: the last year was one of my most challenging ones. And he was right.</description>

      <title>First Retrospection</title>
      <link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/retrospection/cw23/</link>

      <description>I am trying different things at the moment about retro- or introspection for myself. One thing that I know others are doing are weekly mails to all their directs1. I&amp;rsquo;ve also seen this via some form of weekly blog post. My default working mode is transparency so why sending mails to only a few select people when I can also just give them the link. Whomever might be interested later might find this useful - or not.</description>

      <description>So here I am, again claiming to stick to blogging. This time I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a look back at 2018 and my New Year resolutions that will make sure 2019 will be a blast.
Last year was a challenge for me as so many things happened that impacted my work-life. I transitioned into management and became Engineering Lead in the Search department at Zalando. I was surprised at how much I actually like working with people.</description>

      <description>Earlier this month Monica Lent published a list of Tech talks that&amp;rsquo;ll change how you think. Every one on this list is awesome and some have influenced me pretty heavily. Especially Simple made Easy by Rich Hickey. To these I&amp;rsquo;d like to add a few from my list of favorite talks.
Full Stack Awareness In this, Arthur Bergman rants about how everything is broken. We, as engineers, are so used to just connect a few systems and the new feature is working.</description>

      <description>My usual web application stack for the past years was based on a nginx as reverse proxy in front of a number of Python processes. Static resources were served by nginx. Each Python process was stateless, state was stored in some kind of database. If the processes needed some shared ephemeral state like counters a local redis instance solved that. A battle tested common ground for Python based web applications.</description>

      <title>Elasticsearch DSL-DSL</title>

      <description>Elasticsearch is a search server based on Apache Lucene. As a developer it is easy to use, has an expressive query DSL and all is based on JSON serialization. Often though I find myself in a position where I need to adapt queries frequently and non-trivially, say in a demonstration in front of customers or product owners.
The questions are mostly similar: &amp;ldquo;what if I also filter for X&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how does the ranking change, when I add a freshness function&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;do I get a better result if I boost document types Y&amp;rdquo; and so on.</description>

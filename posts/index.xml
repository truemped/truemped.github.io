      <title>Trunk Based Development: Stop PR Reviews!</title>

Cities have foundations,&#xA;like infrastructure for cars, electricity. Housing for people to live and work.&#xA;Stores to sell and buy goods. Also, Cities are often referred to as an&#xA;&lt;em&gt;organism&lt;/em&gt;. Just like a large organization, a department, or a team are an&#xA;&lt;em&gt;organism&lt;/em&gt;. But these organisms are building software.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Year of Silence</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, that was a writer&amp;rsquo;s block. For about a year I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to write a&#xA;response post to Mikio Braun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://mikiobraun.wordpress.com/2021/04/05/creating-software-at-scale/&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Everyone Is Still Terrible At Creating&#xA;Software&lt;/a&gt; post. It resonates a lot with me and has triggered myself into&#xA;completely overthinking my writing. I spent weeks and months over a number of&#xA;drafts, all connected. Never finished. And some are still just in my head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, right now it feels strange to think about how we could build&#xA;software better and how we might set up teams better so that they can actually&#xA;be successful. The events of the last week are beyond mind-blowing and the&#xA;impact on me, the industry, Europe, the World, is not yet clear in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On Psychological Safety</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;More and more work involves collaboration. Multiple people working in a team on&#xA;the same &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt; that is becoming ever more complex. What does this mean for an&#xA;organization? Information and knowledge, especially in the technology domain, is&#xA;becoming a commodity. All the best technical tools to build your next Google is&#xA;just a Google search away. In the age of digital products, market access is&#xA;getting cheaper every day. This increases the importance of the team and their&#xA;effectiveness as it becomes a company&amp;rsquo;s unique selling point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tailscale</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2021/02/tailscale/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday I got to know &lt;a href=&#34;https://tailscale.com&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tailscale&lt;/a&gt; by a complete coincidence. Someone I&#xA;follow on twitter mentioned it:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Oof, Tailscale is groundbreaking. Wireguard vpn itself is magic, kind of like how git was compared to previous scm. And Tailscale is Wireguard&amp;#39;s Github. Makes it accessible to the masses.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Carlo Cabanilla 🌻 (@clofresh) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/clofresh/status/1360105546712576006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What can I say: it blew my mind! I always wanted to setup a VPN connection&#xA;between my droplet and my NAS at home for backups. But of course I was way too&#xA;lazy to configure OpenVPN or something similar. I knew about WireGuard and the&#xA;progress they were making, but had been too lazy to set this up myself. And so&#xA;along comes Tailscale, a fully integrated WireGuard setup and almost a &lt;em&gt;one&#xA;click installation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42774083-leadership-is-language&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Leadership is language&lt;/a&gt; by L. David Marquet, the same&#xA;author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Turn the Ship Around&lt;/a&gt;. In this book, Marquet describes the&#xA;different ways people communicate and how it influences the outcomes we get.&#xA;This should not be any news really, but the book explains in much more detail&#xA;how this happens. Especially when there is a power dynamic between the&#xA;participants of a conversation or meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main theme across the book is the sinking of a ship called &lt;em&gt;El Faro&lt;/em&gt; caused&#xA;by a hurricane. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the ship&#xA;and recovered it&amp;rsquo;s voice recorder. It contained the last 25 hours of&#xA;conversation on the bridge. The sad story is that the people on board were aware&#xA;of the dangerous situation but the environment created by the company and&#xA;captain did not allow for them to speak up. Seeing what they were getting into,&#xA;the subordinates were not capable of convincing the captain to change route. The&#xA;ship sank and all 35 people on board died.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Monolith to Microservice</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Why is moving from a monolithic architecture to a microservices based one so&#xA;hard? And is it worth it? Often those projects happen in organizations that&#xA;were successful in the past and now enter a phase of scaling. This can be&#xA;scaling by adding lots and lots of developers, or by allowing individual scaling&#xA;of sub-components, because the system is screaming under load and is getting&#xA;more and more expensive to run.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: This post was trending on Hackernews in April 2021. See the&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26759903&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In many organizations today there is one thing that almost always is true: there&#xA;are too many things done in parallel, there is too much &lt;em&gt;work-in-progress&lt;/em&gt;,&#xA;everyone is busy but nothing gets done. If this is so ubiquitous why is no one&#xA;doing anything about it? Are people not aware or do they not know how to fix it?&#xA;This is so predominant, that it almost is too easy to just claim:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Campaigns in Elasticsearch</title>
      <link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/04/campaigns-in-elasticsearch/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In e-commerce search enabling dynamic prices or campaigns requires some&#xA;attributes to be more volatile than others. A discount on Black Friday that is&#xA;should only be valid between 7 PM and midnight. The flags that promote the&#xA;discount. The teasers on product listings showing what products will have a&#xA;discount, before the discount is in effect. Products that are only discounted&#xA;for a certain customer group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally this is solved by updating the documents in the search index.&#xA;Around the time new information has to go live, all affected documents are&#xA;updated. There are at least two huge problems with this approach. The first one&#xA;is that updating a large portion of the index takes time. During large sales&#xA;events this easily means updating the whole index. Sometimes more than once if&#xA;your intake pipelines contain loops, e.g. This creates a huge load onto the&#xA;system which at this point can already have a lot of users looking for the deals&#xA;to become active. User facing errors are the last thing you would tolerate at&#xA;that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Onto new Horizons</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The date slowly approached and then it just happened. After almost four years I&#xA;left Zalando end of March. I joined Zalando as Senior Engineer in the search&#xA;team. In this role I helped migrate the search systems from the old monolith&#xA;(&lt;em&gt;Jimmy&lt;/em&gt;) to a microservice based architecture. In those times, microservices&#xA;where meant literally and a lot of them were created.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The system was based on SolrCloud and basically a home-grown Kafka like&#xA;messaging system based on SQS and DynamoDB. A lot of assumptions were baked in&#xA;code. The first Black Friday we were live only on the mobile app. While this was&#xA;successful, extending this system to other clients like the web was a huge&#xA;undertaking. At this point, we decided to move to a much more simple, Kafka&#xA;based intake pipeline and Elasticsearch as the main search index. Back then we&#xA;felt this would be a much more sustainable architecture. And we were right. It&#xA;still has not changed significantly but has been extended over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Aligning through writing documents</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing narratives and technical documents becomes a more and more relevant&#xA;skill to have when navigating today&amp;rsquo;s organizations. Often times successful&#xA;alignment between teams or even departments rely on this form of communication.&#xA;Personally I have seen how I was unable to convey my thoughts and ideas to a&#xA;wider audience simply because I was not able to write them down. Later I learned&#xA;that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; writing them down is not enough to form an alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/02/my-new-writing-habit/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My new habit is starting to form and shape itself. I started the new year with a&#xA;few little habits I want to establish and my writing habit slowly kicks in.&#xA;Originally I intended to take 30 minutes every day to write: my thoughts on this&#xA;blog, comment on documents in the company and finish my own documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until now I have mostly been the reading type of person. Back in school I&amp;rsquo;ve&#xA;spent a significant amount of money on books about programming. This helped me&#xA;to get into the field. Since I moved into management I noticed a similar kind of&#xA;learning path: I again bought &amp;ndash; and am still buying &amp;ndash; books on management and&#xA;leadership. This seems to be my learning habit and my way of getting into a&#xA;specific topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Providing Difficult Feedback</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When moving from an individual contributor role into management, the biggest&#xA;challenge for me was to provide &lt;strong&gt;difficult feedback&lt;/strong&gt;. This might have been&#xA;bigger for me compared to others as within a very short period of time a number&#xA;of my colleagues and peers suddenly started to report to me. Looking back at&#xA;2019 overcoming this has been my biggest personal achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-ruinous-empathy&#34;&gt;&#xA;  What is ruinous empathy?&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#what-is-ruinous-empathy&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the books I read in 2019 is &lt;strong&gt;Radical Candor&lt;/strong&gt;, a &amp;ldquo;new management&#xA;philosophy&amp;rdquo;. It separates management in two dimensions: care personally and&#xA;challenge directly. Based on these you can group management behaviour in four&#xA;groups: &lt;strong&gt;obnoxious aggression&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;manipulative insincerity&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ruinous&#xA;empathy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;radical candor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My first year in Management</title>
      <link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2019/04/first-year/</link>

      <guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2019/04/first-year/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year ago I transitioned into management. I changed my role from Senior&#xA;Software Developer to Engineering Lead in Zalando. In this post I want to share&#xA;my experience, good and bad, things that went well, where I screwed up and what&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m taking from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-difficult-first-year&#34;&gt;&#xA;  A difficult first year&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#a-difficult-first-year&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As my manager put it in my performance review: the last year was one of my most&#xA;challenging ones. And he was right. In theory my game plan was pretty &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;:&#xA;I became Engineering Lead for the team I was an engineer before. A well&#xA;functioning and I might say one of the most high performing teams I&amp;rsquo;ve ever&#xA;worked in. It did not take long though until the team dissolved itself. For one&#xA;member it was clear from the beginning that he would leave. But it did not take&#xA;long until the next engineer from this team said he would leave the company.&#xA;This was a real setback because I value him tremendously as an engineer and&#xA;enjoyed the interactions we had. Sadly he had made up his mind even before I&#xA;became manager and for me there was no way to keep him. Back then and still&#xA;today I was not under the impression that it was because of my transition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So here I am, again claiming to stick to blogging. This time I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a&#xA;look back at 2018 and my New Year resolutions that will make sure 2019 will be a&#xA;blast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last year was a challenge for me as so many things happened that impacted my&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;work-life&lt;/strong&gt;. I transitioned into management and became &lt;strong&gt;Engineering Lead&lt;/strong&gt; in&#xA;the Search department at Zalando. I was surprised at how much I actually like&#xA;working with people. In my life as individual contributor I was mostly writing&#xA;code and argued about it. Now I enjoy understanding someone else&amp;rsquo;s motivation,&#xA;where she is coming from, what her goals are and how I might help her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Favorite Talks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month Monica Lent published a list of&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/01/01/favorite-programming-talks/&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tech talks that&amp;rsquo;ll change how you think&lt;/a&gt;. Every one on this list is awesome&#xA;and some have influenced me pretty heavily. Especially &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Simple made Easy&lt;/a&gt; by&#xA;Rich Hickey. To these I&amp;rsquo;d like to add a few from my list of favorite talks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-stack-awareness&#34;&gt;&#xA;  Full Stack Awareness&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;heading-link&#34; href=&#34;#full-stack-awareness&#34;&gt;&#xA;    &lt;i class=&#34;fa-solid fa-link&#34; aria-hidden=&#34;true&#34; title=&#34;Link to heading&#34;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&#xA;    &lt;span class=&#34;sr-only&#34;&gt;Link to heading&lt;/span&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this, Arthur Bergman rants about how everything is broken. We, as engineers,&#xA;are so used to just connect a few systems and the new feature is working. We&#xA;take so many things for granted that we forget how underlying systems down to&#xA;the operating system work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My usual web application stack for the past years was based on  a nginx as&#xA;reverse proxy in front of a number of Python processes. Static resources were&#xA;served by nginx. Each Python process was stateless, state was stored in some&#xA;kind of database. If the processes needed some shared ephemeral state like&#xA;counters a local redis instance solved that. A battle tested common ground for&#xA;Python based web applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Elasticsearch DSL-DSL</title>

      <guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2015/07/elastic-dsl/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elasticsearch is a search server based on Apache Lucene. As a developer it is&#xA;easy to use, has an expressive query DSL and all is based on JSON&#xA;serialization. Often though I find myself in a position where I need to adapt&#xA;queries frequently and non-trivially, say in a demonstration in front of&#xA;customers or product owners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The questions are mostly similar: &amp;ldquo;what if I also filter for X&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how does the&#xA;ranking change, when I add a freshness function&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;do I get a better result if&#xA;I boost document types Y&amp;rdquo; and so on. While these are easy to add, two things&#xA;bother me: first, I need to come up with the queries during a presentation,&#xA;which adds pauses to the meetings. When I&amp;rsquo;m finished with the query the&#xA;discussion has evolved. Second, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be the enabler. If they can&#xA;find out what they want without me it also means a faster feedback loop for&#xA;them. In brainstorming sessions it is easy to focus on arguments and skip the&#xA;sometimes lengthy query finding pauses. Win win for everyone it seems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

look back at 2018 and my New Year resolutions that will make sure 2019 will be a
blast.</p><p>Last year was a challenge for me as so many things happened that impacted my
<strong>work-life</strong>. I transitioned into management and became <strong>Engineering Lead</strong> in
the Search department at Zalando. I was surprised at how much I actually like
working with people. In my life as individual contributor I was mostly writing
code and argued about it. Now I enjoy understanding someone else&rsquo;s motivation,
where she is coming from, what her goals are and how I might help her.</p><p>And honestly I also like the increased influence: talking to key people in the
organization earlier in the process helps me direct the course better. And
people tend to listen to me more open than before, which obviously is a strange
flaw in the organization. But that is a different topic.</p><p>I read a ton of books and blogs about transitioning. I liked
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>The Manager&rsquo;s Path</a> by Camille Fournier. I started reading
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1317946.Managing_Humans class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Managing Humans</a> and have not yet finished. I did read some old time
classics even before like <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21343.The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>The five dysfunctions of a team</a>, a book you
should probably go through every once in a while. Another great classic is
<a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67825.Peopleware class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Peopleware</a>, short and concise. <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939161-radical-candor class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Radical Candor</a> is on the top of my
reading list. Lately I&rsquo;ve been involved in strategy topics and one great book in
this area is <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11721966-good-strategy-bad-strategy class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Good Strategy/Bad Strategy</a> with a lot of examples for good and
bad strategy.</p><p>I signed up for the <a href=https://softwareleadweekly.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Software Lead Weekly</a> newsletter and joined <a href=https://rands-leadership.slack.com/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Rands
Leadership Slack</a>. Particularly the <strong>face to face</strong> meetings are a great
experience as you get to speak to so many great people from all over the world
about leadership topics. Another benefit is that talking to external leaders
outside of one&rsquo;s organization brings a different, hopefully unbiased perspective
into your work.</p><p>But all of this came at a cost: I&rsquo;m not coding anymore. There are days when I
first open my Laptop after lunch. I had to learn to manage my calendar, block
time for lunch, otherwise people will just add meetings into empty spots.
Prioritization is even more important now as just about everyone wants something
from me.</p><h2 id=my-2019-goals>My 2019 Goals
<a class=heading-link href=#my-2019-goals><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h2><p>In this year I&rsquo;ll be working as manager for almost a full year now. I made
mistakes and I will continue to make them but I want to learn from them.</p><h3 id=keep-on-coding>Keep on Coding
<a class=heading-link href=#keep-on-coding><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>My job title is <em>Engineering</em> Lead. But how can I be an <em>Engineering Lead</em> when
I&rsquo;m not writing code? Or not participating in Code reviews? Architecture
decisions? That does not mean I need to make all the decisions or tell people
how to write code. But I don&rsquo;t want to loose grip. I think it is important to
feel the pain your engineers go through. This could mean taking a 24x7 shift
every once in a while. Or fixing a bug in one of our systems.</p><p>For now I&rsquo;m trying to maintain one of our Kafka Streams components written in
Clojure. I recently contributed patches to <a href=https://github.com/fundingcircle/jackdaw/ class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Jackdaw</a>, a Clojure wrapper for
Kafka Streams. It felt pretty good!</p><h3 id=writing-habit>Writing Habit
<a class=heading-link href=#writing-habit><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>I&rsquo;m also very passionate about good system architecture. Several of the
challenges my teams have today are because it&rsquo;s always easier to build programs
and not systems. That means it&rsquo;s always easier to write a couple of lines of
code and make <em>flag X</em> appear in the domain model. If we would instead focus on
writing code that enables a more general notion of how adding <em>flags</em> to the
domain model, we would not be adding more and more lines to the same code base
for new flags.</p><p>But in order to transport this into the wider organization it is essential to
write things down and share them. In the past I always tried to talk to people
and individually they often agree. But writing things down increases the
audience and hopefully influences more people. But this is something I need to
work on.</p><h3 id=learn-to-say-no>Learn to say no
<a class=heading-link href=#learn-to-say-no><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p><strong>No</strong> is a very powerful word. I cannot save everyone and everything. And
<strong>no</strong> brings me to my next and last goal:</p><h3 id=balance-my-life>Balance my life
<a class=heading-link href=#balance-my-life><i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden=true title="Link to heading"></i>
<span class=sr-only>Link to heading</span></a></h3><p>Paul Adams wrote an interesting piece on
<a href=https://medium.com/@padday/how-i-try-to-organise-my-life-to-make-me-happy-e521541d8691 class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>How I try to organise my life to make me happy</a>. He has some interesting
points and formalizes what many people think. The idea originates from a speech
by <a href=https://youtu.be/BmCTQ_mkzHU class=external-link target=_blank rel=noopener>Matthew McConaughey</a> in 2015 and is about identifying the things that
matter to you and tracking the time spend doing them. Ideally there should be a
balance in all the areas in order to keep you healthy.</p><p>Identifying the things that matter to me is simple as they are exactly the same
as for Paul: Father, Husband, Family, Friend, Colleague, Me. I probably would
not go as far as mapping the results, but keeping track of them in my org-mode
files would be an even nerdier start.</p><p>That is pretty much it. Let&rsquo;s see what I will write in January 2020&mldr;</p></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container>©

        <p>In the past I've often been asked on why we are having 1-on-1 meetings. Mostly
by people that started to report to me or when I insist that we have them at
least every other week. The most frequent questions I get are along the lines of
&ldquo;I don't have any topics&rdquo;, &ldquo;what do we talk about in this meeting&rdquo;, &ldquo;why so
often&rdquo;?</p>
<p>In my own career I've seen many different ways of 1-on-1s. I've worked in
companies with only the yearly performance feedback talk or in companies with
more frequent ones. What I do know for sure is that only having the yearly
performance feedback talk brings up so many surprises that are not good for
either side. But having weekly 1-on-1's can sometimes be too much and endanger
the meeting to become about status updates when they should really be part of
team dailies or something similar.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-is-the-1-on-1-about">So: What is the 1-on-1 about?</h2>
<p>First and foremost the 1-on-1 meeting is for you, not for me, your manager. The
more you are prepared to have this meeting, the more you can get out. But &ldquo;what
do I get out?&rdquo; Imagine a meeting where you can ask someone &ldquo;how am I doing?&quot;,
&ldquo;do you have feedback for me?&quot;, &ldquo;X and Y is not working in the team, we need to
improve Z&rdquo;, &ldquo;I am stuck with this problem and nobody can help&rdquo;. This is the main
contents of the 1-on-1 meeting. Work-life is getting ever more complex and it's
hard to keep track of everything. In this meeting you have a chance to get the
clarity that you need in order to be good at your job and also make sure work is
aligned with your personal interests.</p>
<p>In some of my 1-on-1 meetings there is seemingly nothing to talk about. You
might have spent the whole week in workshops with the team and been discussing
many different work-related topics. Feedback was ideally shared in or shortly
after the meetings. For these meetings I've created a habit to ask my colleague
questions along the lines of: &ldquo;what is not working&rdquo;, &ldquo;what do we need to get
better at&rdquo;. Ideally this helps me verify my own observations of the team and its
individuals. But sometimes topics arise that were previously unknown to me or
of no high priority.</p>
<h2 id="my-own-experience">My own experience</h2>
<p>In the past, 1-on-1 meetings with my colleagues where scattered across my
calendar. There were 30 minute slots for everyone every two weeks in between
other meetings. While this kind of works, it's difficult for me to keep track of
action items and I hardly have time to prepare or revise the meetings. Going
forward I'm aligning my 1-on-1 meetings based on a few simple principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>A shared Google doc or Asana Board</li>
<li>A monthly focus on development</li>
<li>New members in the team start at weekly cadence</li>
<li>Might switch to bi-weekly depending on your needs</li>
<li>Ad-hoc requests must be possible and the highest priority</li>
<li>Create concentrated blocks of 1-on-1's across the week</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="more-background-reading">More background reading</h2>
<p>There is a ton of great material available to get started on how you approach
the next 1-on-1. This <a href="https://www.fellow.app/blog/2019/one-on-one-meeting-template/">meeting template</a> provides a list of questions your
manager might ask to kick-start the conversation. I personally use this list
from time to time to get some ice-breaking questions. The list also contains
some background information about the individual intents.</p>
<p>Another example agenda is over at <a href="https://dandoadvisors.com/1-on-1-meetings-agenda/">dandoadvisors</a>. Besides another list of
potential question candidates they also write about the <a href="https://dandoadvisors.com/5-15-format/">5:15 format</a>, a
simple weekly pulse check on how the people in your organization are doing.</p>
<p>And a special honorable mention to the <a href="https://medium.com/leading-and-managing/management-by-walking-around-motivating-and-developing-staff-9bac6258f544">management by walking around</a>
technique. 1-on-1 meetings mostly take place in meeting rooms where you sit
opposite to your manager. Especially in times of more complications and tougher
discussions, taking a step outside and taking a walk can move mountains. The
greatest and deepest interactions I had while taking a walk outside. I don't
exactly know why, but during these walks a much deeper and more open discussion
is possible. Next time, you have tough questions or are struggling, ask your
manager for a walk. Maybe just once around the block.</p>

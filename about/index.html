About Me
</a>
</h1>
</header>
<p>I am currently working as Principal Engineer at <a href=https://www.zalando.de>Zalando</a> and started my
professional career in 2008. By now I have gathered experience as Software
Engineer, Consultant, Architct, and Engineering Manager.</p>
<p>For the longest time Search is my passion. I have experience in consulting,
implementing small and large and complex Search systems. Another passion of mine
is event streaming. Today I&rsquo;m helping teams to understand, architect, and implement
tracking systems.</p>
<p>In 2018 I transitioned into management and worked as Engineering Manager.
Working with and for people is still the most rewarding thing for me. Helping
someone grow and uncovering their potential is extremely gratifying.</p>
<p>After learning about the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints>Theory of Constraints</a> I am trying to understand
how we can work better and more effectively in the IT industry. This blog is my
personal effort towards understanding this better.</p>
<p>I am collecting core <a href=https://truemped.github.io/ideas-concepts/>Ideas & Concepts</a> that influenced my thinking and my
actions. I use them as reference in my blog posts.</p>

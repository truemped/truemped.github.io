      <description>two people in front of a computer doing pair programming in the style of a picasso painting (DALLE)&#xA;Engineering effectiveness is a prominent topic. Traditional Pull Request (PR) reviews show their limitations when it comes to efficiency, knowledge sharing, and delivering value.

      <description>In the past I&#39;ve often been asked on why we are having 1-on-1 meetings. Mostly by people that started to report to me or when I insist that we have them at least every other week. The most frequent questions I get are along the lines of &amp;ldquo;I don&#39;t have any topics&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;what do we talk about in this meeting&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;why so often&amp;rdquo;?
In my own career I&#39;ve seen many different ways of 1-on-1s.</description>

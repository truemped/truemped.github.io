David Marquet, the same
author of &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turn the Ship Around&lt;/a>. In this book, Marquet describes the
different ways people communicate and how it influences the outcomes we get.
This should not be any news really, but the book explains in much more detail
how this happens. Especially when there is a power dynamic between the
participants of a conversation or meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main theme across the book is the sinking of a ship called &lt;em>El Faro&lt;/em> caused
by a hurricane. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the ship
and recovered it&amp;rsquo;s voice recorder. It contained the last 25 hours of
conversation on the bridge. The sad story is that the people on board were aware
of the dangerous situation but the environment created by the company and
captain did not allow for them to speak up. Seeing what they were getting into,
the subordinates were not capable of convincing the captain to change route. The
ship sank and all 35 people on board died.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

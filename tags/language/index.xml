      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42774083-leadership-is-language&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Leadership is language&lt;/a&gt; by L. David Marquet, the same&#xA;author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16158601-turn-the-ship-around&#34;  class=&#34;external-link&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Turn the Ship Around&lt;/a&gt;. In this book, Marquet describes the&#xA;different ways people communicate and how it influences the outcomes we get.&#xA;This should not be any news really, but the book explains in much more detail&#xA;how this happens. Especially when there is a power dynamic between the&#xA;participants of a conversation or meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main theme across the book is the sinking of a ship called &lt;em&gt;El Faro&lt;/em&gt; caused&#xA;by a hurricane. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the ship&#xA;and recovered it&amp;rsquo;s voice recorder. It contained the last 25 hours of&#xA;conversation on the bridge. The sad story is that the people on board were aware&#xA;of the dangerous situation but the environment created by the company and&#xA;captain did not allow for them to speak up. Seeing what they were getting into,&#xA;the subordinates were not capable of convincing the captain to change route. The&#xA;ship sank and all 35 people on board died.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

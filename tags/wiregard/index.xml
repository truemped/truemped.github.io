Someone I
follow on twitter mentioned it:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oof, Tailscale is groundbreaking. Wireguard vpn itself is magic, kind of like how git was compared to previous scm. And Tailscale is Wireguard&amp;#39;s Github. Makes it accessible to the masses.&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Carlo Cabanilla ðŸŒ» (@clofresh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/clofresh/status/1360105546712576006?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2021&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;p>What can I say: it blew my mind! I always wanted to setup a VPN connection
between my droplet and my NAS at home for backups. But of course I was way too
lazy to configure OpenVPN or something similar. I knew about WireGuard and the
progress they were making, but had been too lazy to set this up myself. And so
along comes Tailscale, a fully integrated WireGuard setup and almost a &lt;em>one
click installation&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

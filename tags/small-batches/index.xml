      <description>Well, that was a writer&amp;rsquo;s block. For about a year I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to write a response post to Mikio Braun&amp;rsquo;s Everyone Is Still Terrible At Creating Software post. It resonates a lot with me and has triggered myself into completely overthinking my writing. I spent weeks and months over a number of drafts, all connected. Never finished. And some are still just in my head.
To be honest, right now it feels strange to think about how we could build software better and how we might set up teams better so that they can actually be successful.</description>

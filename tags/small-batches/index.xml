For about a year I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to write a
response post to Mikio Braun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://mikiobraun.wordpress.com/2021/04/05/creating-software-at-scale/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everyone Is Still Terrible At Creating
Software&lt;/a> post. It resonates a lot with me and has triggered myself into
completely overthinking my writing. I spent weeks and months over a number of
drafts, all connected. Never finished. And some are still just in my head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest, right now it feels strange to think about how we could build
software better and how we might set up teams better so that they can actually
be successful. The events of the last week are beyond mind-blowing and the
impact on me, the industry, Europe, the World, is not yet clear in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

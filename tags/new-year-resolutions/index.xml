      <description>&lt;p&gt;So here I am, again claiming to stick to blogging. This time I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a&#xA;look back at 2018 and my New Year resolutions that will make sure 2019 will be a&#xA;blast.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last year was a challenge for me as so many things happened that impacted my&#xA;&lt;strong&gt;work-life&lt;/strong&gt;. I transitioned into management and became &lt;strong&gt;Engineering Lead&lt;/strong&gt; in&#xA;the Search department at Zalando. I was surprised at how much I actually like&#xA;working with people. In my life as individual contributor I was mostly writing&#xA;code and argued about it. Now I enjoy understanding someone else&amp;rsquo;s motivation,&#xA;where she is coming from, what her goals are and how I might help her.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

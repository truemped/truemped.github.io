This time I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a
look back at 2018 and my New Year resolutions that will make sure 2019 will be a
blast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year was a challenge for me as so many things happened that impacted my
&lt;strong>work-life&lt;/strong>. I transitioned into management and became &lt;strong>Engineering Lead&lt;/strong> in
the Search department at Zalando. I was surprised at how much I actually like
working with people. In my life as individual contributor I was mostly writing
code and argued about it. Now I enjoy understanding someone else&amp;rsquo;s motivation,
where she is coming from, what her goals are and how I might help her.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

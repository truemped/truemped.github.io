I changed my role from Senior
Software Developer to Engineering Lead in Zalando. In this post I want to share
my experience, good and bad, things that went well, where I screwed up and what
I&amp;rsquo;m taking from it.&lt;/p>

 A difficult first year

 &lt;span class="sr-only">Link to heading&lt;/span>
 &lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As my manager put it in my performance review: the last year was one of my most
challenging ones. And he was right. In theory my game plan was pretty &lt;em>simple&lt;/em>:
I became Engineering Lead for the team I was an engineer before. A well
functioning and I might say one of the most high performing teams I&amp;rsquo;ve ever
worked in. It did not take long though until the team dissolved itself. For one
member it was clear from the beginning that he would leave. But it did not take
long until the next engineer from this team said he would leave the company.
This was a real setback because I value him tremendously as an engineer and
enjoyed the interactions we had. Sadly he had made up his mind even before I
became manager and for me there was no way to keep him. Back then and still
today I was not under the impression that it was because of my transition.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

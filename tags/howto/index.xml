      <description>&lt;p&gt;In e-commerce search enabling dynamic prices or campaigns requires some&#xA;attributes to be more volatile than others. A discount on Black Friday that is&#xA;should only be valid between 7 PM and midnight. The flags that promote the&#xA;discount. The teasers on product listings showing what products will have a&#xA;discount, before the discount is in effect. Products that are only discounted&#xA;for a certain customer group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally this is solved by updating the documents in the search index.&#xA;Around the time new information has to go live, all affected documents are&#xA;updated. There are at least two huge problems with this approach. The first one&#xA;is that updating a large portion of the index takes time. During large sales&#xA;events this easily means updating the whole index. Sometimes more than once if&#xA;your intake pipelines contain loops, e.g. This creates a huge load onto the&#xA;system which at this point can already have a lot of users looking for the deals&#xA;to become active. User facing errors are the last thing you would tolerate at&#xA;that time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

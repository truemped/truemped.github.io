Continuous delivery is the holy grail of building software. Not just continuous integration, like running your whole test suite on every push or pull request. Deploying multiple times a day improves cycle times.

      <description>Update: This post was trending on Hackernews in April 2021. See the discussion.
In many organizations today there is one thing that almost always is true: there are too many things done in parallel, there is too much work-in-progress, everyone is busy but nothing gets done. If this is so ubiquitous why is no one doing anything about it? Are people not aware or do they not know how to fix it?</description>

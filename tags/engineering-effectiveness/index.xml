&lt;p>Engineering effectiveness is a prominent topic.
Traditional Pull Request (PR) reviews show their limitations when it comes to efficiency, knowledge sharing, and delivering value.
Instead, trunk based development, coupled with methodologies such as pair and mob programming, are a superior process.
Along with the strategic utilization of feature flags, this methodology presents an alluring argument for a more agile and streamlined software delivery.
I want to describe the challenges posed by conventional PR reviews and show the benefits of doing things differently.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Feature Flags</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2023/03/on-feature-flags/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 22:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2023/03/on-feature-flags/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

&lt;p>Continuous &lt;em>delivery&lt;/em> is the holy grail of building software.
Not just continuous integration, like running your whole test suite on every push or pull request.
Deploying multiple times a day improves cycle times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if you are still trying to make this happen in your organization.
If you are still trying to workout the details of &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canary releases&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue/Green&lt;/a> deployments, or traffic switching in Kubernetes: don&amp;rsquo;t do it.
Those ideas are great, but they have also aged.
They require a lot of additional tooling and automation to get right.
And knowing when a traffic switch of a new feature is successful, is non trivial.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Psychological Safety</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2021/04/psychological-safety/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Apr 2021 09:50:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2021/04/psychological-safety/</guid><description>&lt;p>More and more work involves collaboration. Multiple people working in a team on
the same &lt;em>thing&lt;/em> that is becoming ever more complex. What does this mean for an
organization? Information and knowledge, especially in the technology domain, is
becoming a commodity. All the best technical tools to build your next Google is
just a Google search away. In the age of digital products, market access is
getting cheaper every day. This increases the importance of the team and their
effectiveness as it becomes a company&amp;rsquo;s unique selling point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Limiting Work In Progress</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/10/limiting-wip/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Oct 2020 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/10/limiting-wip/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>: This post was trending on Hackernews in April 2021. See the

&lt;p>In many organizations today there is one thing that almost always is true: there
are too many things done in parallel, there is too much &lt;em>work-in-progress&lt;/em>,
everyone is busy but nothing gets done. If this is so ubiquitous why is no one
doing anything about it? Are people not aware or do they not know how to fix it?
This is so predominant, that it almost is too easy to just claim:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

      <description>Well, that was a writer&amp;rsquo;s block. For about a year I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to write a response post to Mikio Braun&amp;rsquo;s Everyone Is Still Terrible At Creating Software post. It resonates a lot with me and has triggered myself into completely overthinking my writing. I spent weeks and months over a number of drafts, all connected. Never finished. And some are still just in my head.&#xA;To be honest, right now it feels strange to think about how we could build software better and how we might set up teams better so that they can actually be successful.</description>

      <description>Writing narratives and technical documents becomes a more and more relevant skill to have when navigating today&amp;rsquo;s organizations. Often times successful alignment between teams or even departments rely on this form of communication. Personally I have seen how I was unable to convey my thoughts and ideas to a wider audience simply because I was not able to write them down. Later I learned that only writing them down is not enough to form an alignment.</description>

      <description>My new habit is starting to form and shape itself. I started the new year with a few little habits I want to establish and my writing habit slowly kicks in. Originally I intended to take 30 minutes every day to write: my thoughts on this blog, comment on documents in the company and finish my own documents.&#xA;Until now I have mostly been the reading type of person. Back in school I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a significant amount of money on books about programming.</description>

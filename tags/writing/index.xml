&lt;p>After five years of working backwards, writing some and reading even more documents, I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered a few thoughts on why writing is hard and the mistakes I often see people making.&lt;/p>

 On Working Backwards

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Working Backwards&amp;rdquo; is a concept developed at Amazon.
It focuses on starting from the customer and working backward to ensure solutions are relevant.
This is, of course, just a brief introduction.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the details, I recommend reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets/dp/1529033829" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon&lt;/a> by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Year of Silence</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2022/03/a-year-of-silence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 14:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2022/03/a-year-of-silence/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, that was a writer&amp;rsquo;s block. For about a year I&amp;rsquo;ve been planning to write a
response post to Mikio Braun&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://mikiobraun.wordpress.com/2021/04/05/creating-software-at-scale/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everyone Is Still Terrible At Creating
Software&lt;/a> post. It resonates a lot with me and has triggered myself into
completely overthinking my writing. I spent weeks and months over a number of
drafts, all connected. Never finished. And some are still just in my head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest, right now it feels strange to think about how we could build
software better and how we might set up teams better so that they can actually
be successful. The events of the last week are beyond mind-blowing and the
impact on me, the industry, Europe, the World, is not yet clear in my opinion.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Aligning through writing documents</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/03/aligning-through-writing-documents/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/03/aligning-through-writing-documents/</guid><description>&lt;p>Writing narratives and technical documents becomes a more and more relevant
skill to have when navigating today&amp;rsquo;s organizations. Often times successful
alignment between teams or even departments rely on this form of communication.
Personally I have seen how I was unable to convey my thoughts and ideas to a
wider audience simply because I was not able to write them down. Later I learned
that &lt;em>only&lt;/em> writing them down is not enough to form an alignment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My new writing habit</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/02/my-new-writing-habit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/02/my-new-writing-habit/</guid><description>&lt;p>My new habit is starting to form and shape itself. I started the new year with a
few little habits I want to establish and my writing habit slowly kicks in.
Originally I intended to take 30 minutes every day to write: my thoughts on this
blog, comment on documents in the company and finish my own documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until now I have mostly been the reading type of person. Back in school I&amp;rsquo;ve
spent a significant amount of money on books about programming. This helped me
to get into the field. Since I moved into management I noticed a similar kind of
learning path: I again bought &amp;ndash; and am still buying &amp;ndash; books on management and
leadership. This seems to be my learning habit and my way of getting into a
specific topic.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

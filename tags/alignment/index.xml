      <description>&lt;p&gt;Writing narratives and technical documents becomes a more and more relevant&#xA;skill to have when navigating today&amp;rsquo;s organizations. Often times successful&#xA;alignment between teams or even departments rely on this form of communication.&#xA;Personally I have seen how I was unable to convey my thoughts and ideas to a&#xA;wider audience simply because I was not able to write them down. Later I learned&#xA;that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; writing them down is not enough to form an alignment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

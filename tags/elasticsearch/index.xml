      <description>In e-commerce search enabling dynamic prices or campaigns requires some attributes to be more volatile than others. A discount on Black Friday that is should only be valid between 7 PM and midnight. The flags that promote the discount. The teasers on product listings showing what products will have a discount, before the discount is in effect. Products that are only discounted for a certain customer group.&#xA;Traditionally this is solved by updating the documents in the search index.</description>

      <description>Elasticsearch is a search server based on Apache Lucene. As a developer it is easy to use, has an expressive query DSL and all is based on JSON serialization. Often though I find myself in a position where I need to adapt queries frequently and non-trivially, say in a demonstration in front of customers or product owners.&#xA;The questions are mostly similar: &amp;ldquo;what if I also filter for X&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how does the ranking change, when I add a freshness function&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;do I get a better result if I boost document types Y&amp;rdquo; and so on.</description>

&lt;p>After five years of working backwards, writing some and reading even more documents, I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered a few thoughts on why writing is hard and the mistakes I often see people making.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Working Backwards&amp;rdquo; is a concept developed at Amazon.
It focuses on starting from the customer and working backward to ensure solutions are relevant.
This is, of course, just a brief introduction.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the details, I recommend reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.de/Working-Backwards-Insights-Stories-Secrets/dp/1529033829" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon&lt;/a> by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trunk Based Development: Stop PR Reviews!</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2023/08/trunk-based-development/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 19:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2023/08/trunk-based-development/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

&lt;p>Engineering effectiveness is a prominent topic.
Traditional Pull Request (PR) reviews show their limitations when it comes to efficiency, knowledge sharing, and delivering value.
Instead, trunk based development, coupled with methodologies such as pair and mob programming, are a superior process.
Along with the strategic utilization of feature flags, this methodology presents an alluring argument for a more agile and streamlined software delivery.
I want to describe the challenges posed by conventional PR reviews and show the benefits of doing things differently.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Feature Flags</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2023/03/on-feature-flags/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 22:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2023/03/on-feature-flags/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

&lt;p>Continuous &lt;em>delivery&lt;/em> is the holy grail of building software.
Not just continuous integration, like running your whole test suite on every push or pull request.
Deploying multiple times a day improves cycle times.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if you are still trying to make this happen in your organization.
If you are still trying to workout the details of &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canary releases&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BlueGreenDeployment.html" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blue/Green&lt;/a> deployments, or traffic switching in Kubernetes: don&amp;rsquo;t do it.
Those ideas are great, but they have also aged.
They require a lot of additional tooling and automation to get right.
And knowing when a traffic switch of a new feature is successful, is non trivial.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Buy versus Build</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2022/07/buy-vs-build/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Jul 2022 15:28:45 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2022/07/buy-vs-build/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

&lt;p>This is maybe the most complex question that is never asked in the interview process in tech.
And often not even on a managerial level.
But: it is such an interesting one to discuss!
There might be no right or wrong.
But it does reveal a lot about people&amp;rsquo;s thought processes and mental models they have collected.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cities of Software</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2022/03/cities-of-software/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 17:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2022/03/cities-of-software/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

&lt;p>Cities are an interesting way to think about Software. Cities have foundations,
like infrastructure for cars, electricity. Housing for people to live and work.
Stores to sell and buy goods. Also, Cities are often referred to as an
&lt;em>organism&lt;/em>. Just like a large organization, a department, or a team are an
&lt;em>organism&lt;/em>. But these organisms are building software.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Year of Silence</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2022/03/a-year-of-silence/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Mar 2022 14:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2022/03/a-year-of-silence/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, that was a writer&amp;rsquo;s block.

Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford. In this novel, they describe a
hypothetical company, a car parts shop that is in the process of digitalization
and establishing itself as an e-commerce store. Through the story the main
character learns and describes different aspects of managing teams and projects.
The influences are obvious: the Toyota Production System, Lean Processes, the
Theory of Constraints. And the novel itself was heavily influenced by Eliyahu

lazy to configure OpenVPN or something similar. I knew about WireGuard and the
progress they were making, but had been too lazy to set this up myself. And so
along comes Tailscale, a fully integrated WireGuard setup and almost a &lt;em>one

different ways people communicate and how it influences the outcomes we get.
This should not be any news really, but the book explains in much more detail
how this happens. Especially when there is a power dynamic between the
participants of a conversation or meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main theme across the book is the sinking of a ship called &lt;em>El Faro&lt;/em> caused
by a hurricane. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found the ship
and recovered it&amp;rsquo;s voice recorder. It contained the last 25 hours of
conversation on the bridge. The sad story is that the people on board were aware
of the dangerous situation but the environment created by the company and
captain did not allow for them to speak up. Seeing what they were getting into,
the subordinates were not capable of convincing the captain to change route. The
ship sank and all 35 people on board died.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monolith to Microservice</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/11/monolith-to-microservice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 11:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/11/monolith-to-microservice/</guid><description>&lt;p>Why is moving from a monolithic architecture to a microservices based one so

of sub-components, because the system is screaming under load and is getting

attributes to be more volatile than others. A discount on Black Friday that is
should only be valid between 7 PM and midnight. The flags that promote the
discount. The teasers on product listings showing what products will have a
discount, before the discount is in effect. Products that are only discounted
for a certain customer group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Traditionally this is solved by updating the documents in the search index.
Around the time new information has to go live, all affected documents are
updated. There are at least two huge problems with this approach. The first one
is that updating a large portion of the index takes time. During large sales
events this easily means updating the whole index. Sometimes more than once if
your intake pipelines contain loops, e.g. This creates a huge load onto the
system which at this point can already have a lot of users looking for the deals
to become active. User facing errors are the last thing you would tolerate at
that time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Onto new Horizons</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/04/onto-new-horizons/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 17:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/04/onto-new-horizons/</guid><description>&lt;p>The date slowly approached and then it just happened. After almost four years I
left Zalando end of March. I joined Zalando as Senior Engineer in the search
team. In this role I helped migrate the search systems from the old monolith
(&lt;em>Jimmy&lt;/em>) to a microservice based architecture. In those times, microservices
where meant literally and a lot of them were created.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system was based on SolrCloud and basically a home-grown Kafka like
messaging system based on SQS and DynamoDB. A lot of assumptions were baked in
code. The first Black Friday we were live only on the mobile app. While this was
successful, extending this system to other clients like the web was a huge
undertaking. At this point, we decided to move to a much more simple, Kafka
based intake pipeline and Elasticsearch as the main search index. Back then we
felt this would be a much more sustainable architecture. And we were right. It
still has not changed significantly but has been extended over time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Aligning through writing documents</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/03/aligning-through-writing-documents/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Mar 2020 11:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/03/aligning-through-writing-documents/</guid><description>&lt;p>Writing narratives and technical documents becomes a more and more relevant
skill to have when navigating today&amp;rsquo;s organizations. Often times successful
alignment between teams or even departments rely on this form of communication.
Personally I have seen how I was unable to convey my thoughts and ideas to a
wider audience simply because I was not able to write them down. Later I learned
that &lt;em>only&lt;/em> writing them down is not enough to form an alignment.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My new writing habit</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/02/my-new-writing-habit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2020 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/02/my-new-writing-habit/</guid><description>&lt;p>My new habit is starting to form and shape itself. I started the new year with a
few little habits I want to establish and my writing habit slowly kicks in.
Originally I intended to take 30 minutes every day to write: my thoughts on this
blog, comment on documents in the company and finish my own documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until now I have mostly been the reading type of person. Back in school I&amp;rsquo;ve
spent a significant amount of money on books about programming. This helped me
to get into the field. Since I moved into management I noticed a similar kind of
learning path: I again bought &amp;ndash; and am still buying &amp;ndash; books on management and
leadership. This seems to be my learning habit and my way of getting into a
specific topic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Providing Difficult Feedback</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/01/providing-difficult-feedback/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Jan 2020 11:25:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2020/01/providing-difficult-feedback/</guid><description>&lt;p>When moving from an individual contributor role into management, the biggest
challenge for me was to provide &lt;strong>difficult feedback&lt;/strong>. This might have been
bigger for me compared to others as within a very short period of time a number
of my colleagues and peers suddenly started to report to me. Looking back at
2019 overcoming this has been my biggest personal achievement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the books I read in 2019 is &lt;strong>Radical Candor&lt;/strong>, a &amp;ldquo;new management
philosophy&amp;rdquo;. It separates management in two dimensions: care personally and
challenge directly. Based on these you can group management behaviour in four
groups: &lt;strong>obnoxious aggression&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>manipulative insincerity&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>ruinous
empathy&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>radical candor&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My first year in Management</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2019/04/first-year/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2019/04/first-year/</guid><description>&lt;p>About a year ago I transitioned into management. I changed my role from Senior
Software Developer to Engineering Lead in Zalando. In this post I want to share
my experience, good and bad, things that went well, where I screwed up and what
I&amp;rsquo;m taking from it.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As my manager put it in my performance review: the last year was one of my most
challenging ones. And he was right. In theory my game plan was pretty &lt;em>simple&lt;/em>:
I became Engineering Lead for the team I was an engineer before. A well
functioning and I might say one of the most high performing teams I&amp;rsquo;ve ever
worked in. It did not take long though until the team dissolved itself. For one
member it was clear from the beginning that he would leave. But it did not take
long until the next engineer from this team said he would leave the company.
This was a real setback because I value him tremendously as an engineer and
enjoyed the interactions we had. Sadly he had made up his mind even before I
became manager and for me there was no way to keep him. Back then and still
today I was not under the impression that it was because of my transition.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Year Resolutions</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2019/01/new-year-resolutions-2019/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Jan 2019 17:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2019/01/new-year-resolutions-2019/</guid><description>&lt;p>So here I am, again claiming to stick to blogging. This time I&amp;rsquo;ll start with a
look back at 2018 and my New Year resolutions that will make sure 2019 will be a
blast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year was a challenge for me as so many things happened that impacted my
&lt;strong>work-life&lt;/strong>. I transitioned into management and became &lt;strong>Engineering Lead&lt;/strong> in
the Search department at Zalando. I was surprised at how much I actually like
working with people. In my life as individual contributor I was mostly writing
code and argued about it. Now I enjoy understanding someone else&amp;rsquo;s motivation,
where she is coming from, what her goals are and how I might help her.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Favorite Talks</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2019/01/favorite-talks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jan 2019 10:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2019/01/favorite-talks/</guid><description>&lt;p>Earlier this month Monica Lent published a list of

&lt;p>In this, Arthur Bergman rants about how everything is broken. We, as engineers,
are so used to just connect a few systems and the new feature is working. We
take so many things for granted that we forget how underlying systems down to
the operating system work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/2019/01/about-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Jan 2019 09:41:34 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/2019/01/about-me/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am an experienced Head of Engineering currently working at &lt;a href="https://www.zalando.de" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zalando&lt;/a>.
My professional career started in 2008.
By now I have gathered experience as Software Engineer, Consultant, Architect, Engineering Manager, and Head of Engineering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the longest time Search was my passion.
I have experience in consulting, implementing small, large, and complex Search systems.
Building a Search platform especially in a larger organization formed my passion for event streaming systems.
This has helped multiple teams get their data into Search in a simple and scalable way.
I also applied this to help teams understand, architect, and implement large scale tracking systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Varnish All the Things</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2016/02/varnish-all-the-things/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2016 12:15:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2016/02/varnish-all-the-things/</guid><description>&lt;p>My usual web application stack for the past years was based on a nginx as
reverse proxy in front of a number of Python processes. Static resources were
served by nginx. Each Python process was stateless, state was stored in some
kind of database. If the processes needed some shared ephemeral state like
counters a local redis instance solved that. A battle tested common ground for
Python based web applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Elasticsearch DSL-DSL</title><link>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2015/07/elastic-dsl/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Jul 2015 10:19:47 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://truemped.github.io/posts/2015/07/elastic-dsl/</guid><description>&lt;p>Elasticsearch is a search server based on Apache Lucene. As a developer it is
easy to use, has an expressive query DSL and all is based on JSON
serialization. Often though I find myself in a position where I need to adapt
queries frequently and non-trivially, say in a demonstration in front of
customers or product owners.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The questions are mostly similar: &amp;ldquo;what if I also filter for X&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;how does the
ranking change, when I add a freshness function&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;do I get a better result if
I boost document types Y&amp;rdquo; and so on. While these are easy to add, two things
bother me: first, I need to come up with the queries during a presentation,
which adds pauses to the meetings. When I&amp;rsquo;m finished with the query the
discussion has evolved. Second, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be the enabler. If they can
find out what they want without me it also means a faster feedback loop for
them. In brainstorming sessions it is easy to focus on arguments and skip the
sometimes lengthy query finding pauses. Win win for everyone it seems.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

{:title "Start a blog"
 :layout :post}

This is my blog. I haven't really blogged ever. Few people near me do. I so far
did not think that I have something interesting to say. And there are already
tons of blogs out there which probably have the same contents as this one.

So why do I blog now? First, maybe I'm wrong. And by not blogging I will just
never find out. Also, occasionally leaving your comfort zone might not be the
worst idea.

Second, I hope to be better at expressing thoughts, ideas and arguments in
written form rather than longer discussions over beers or in meetings ad work.
Unfortunately I have the habit of basically stop listening when the discussion
is getting too long. Talking for the sake of talking is not my business.

Finally, I want to make it a habit. In the past 18 months or so there were ups
and downs but overall life is pretty good to me. I've learnt a new programming
language ([Clojure](http://clojure.org)), I'm at
[inbox zero](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/zero-dark-inbox)
constantly and just recently I started organizing life and work using
[org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) and
[getting things done](http://gtdfh.branchable.com/). The next step for me is to
flush my head whenever possible and maybe something interesting will be produced
as well.

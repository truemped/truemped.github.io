I am not using WhatsApp. I also do not have a Facebook account. For Facebook it
is easy: I'm just not into sharing my personal life online and keeping in touch
with friends can be done without it. WhatsApp is somewhat different. It's
basically a replacement of text messages on steroids because you can have
groups.

My primary reasons for not using it are: encryption, sharing my phone number
with Facebook and open source. For this reason I was and still am promoting
[Signal](https://whispersystems.org/). The
[code](https://github.com/WhisperSystems) is available for anyone to read and
audit and cryptography scientists have reviewed it. You can run your own
[server](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/TextSecure-Server) so you don't rely
on any organization to run the server for you.

With the latest news of WhatsApp adding encryption by default and using the
Signal protocol this argument is void. So it boils down to the one question: do
I trust Facebook with my data? I have no way to check their code and see if
there is a backdoor that circumvent the encryption.

But here is the thing: Facebook already has my data. Since WhatsApp downloads
the address book of all my friends that have it installed, they already know my
phone number. They can even guess what my social network roughly looks like.

So I'm doomed. And I'm asking myself: do I keep being the one person in the room
not using WhatsApp?

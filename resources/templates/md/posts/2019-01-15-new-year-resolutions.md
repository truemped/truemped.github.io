{:title "New Year resolutions"
 :layout :post}
 
It's 2019, a new year, a fresh start and another chance at starting over. Or so
they say.

Last year was a challenge for me as so many things happened that impacted my
**work-life**. I transitioned into management and became **Engineering Lead**.
Today I'm leading three teams in the Search department at Zalando. I was
surprised at how much I actually like working with people. In my life as
individual contributor I was mostly writing code and argued about it. Now I
enjoy understanding someone else motivation, where she is coming from and what
their goals are.

I read a ton of books and information about transitioning. I liked
[The Manager's Path][2] by Camille Fournier. I started reading
[Managing Humans][3] and have not yet finished. I did read some old time
classics even before like [The five dysfunctions of a team][4], a book you
should probably go through every once in a while. Another great classic is
[Peopleware][5], short and concise. Lately I've been involved in strategy topics
and one great book in this area is [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy][6] with a lot of
examples for good and bad strategy.

I signed up for the [Software Lead Weekly][7] newsletter and joined
[Rands Leadership Slack][8]. Particularly the **face to face** meetings are a
great experience as you get to speak to so many great people from all over the
world about leadership topics.

But it came at a cost: I'm not coding anymore. There are days when I first open
my Laptop after lunch. I had to learn to manage my calendar, block time for
lunch, otherwise people will just add meetings into empty spots.

* Outlook to 2019

### My Resolutions

#### Keep on Coding

#### Writing Habit

#### Balance my life

Paul Adams wrote an interesting piece on
[How I try to organise my life to make me happy][0]. He has some interesting
points and formalizes what many people think. The idea originates from a speech
by [Matthew McConaughey][1] in 2015 and is about identifying the things that
matter to you and tracking the time spend doing them. Ideally there should be a
balance in all the areas in order to keep you healthy.

Identifying the things that matter to me is simple as they are exactly the same
as for Paul: Father, Husband, Family, Friend, Colleague, Me. I probably would
not go as far as mapping the results, but keeping track of them in my org-mode
files would be an even nerdier start.

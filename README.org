This is the repository hosting my private blog.

* Operations
This is to document how to run, build and serve the blog. First, clone the
repository including submodules like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/truemped/truemped.github.io.git
$ cd truemped.github.io/
#+END_SRC

** Run locally

This blog is built using [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]]. To run locally, simply run

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ hugo server
#+END_SRC

** Building

To build the final result, simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ hugo
#+END_SRC

** Publishing

The `public` directory is, well, public. All files in there will be publicly
available at https://truemped.github.io. This directory is also a special branch
in the Github repository. Committing the changes and pushing them will publish
them.

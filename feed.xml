Start a blog

<description>
&lt;p&gt;This is my blog. I haven't really blogged ever. Few people near me do. I so far did not think that I have something interesting to say. And there are already tons of blogs out there which probably have the same contents as this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why do I blog now? First, maybe I'm wrong. And by not blogging I will just never find out. Also, occasionally leaving your comfort zone might not be the worst idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, I hope to be better at expressing thoughts, ideas and arguments in written form rather than longer discussions over beers or in meetings ad work. Unfortunately I have the habit of basically stop listening when the discussion is getting too long. Talking for the sake of talking is not my business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I want to make it a habit. In the past 18 months or so there were ups and downs but overall life is pretty good to me. I've learnt a new programming language (&lt;a href='http://clojure.org'&gt;Clojure&lt;/a&gt;), I'm at &lt;a href='http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/zero-dark-inbox'&gt;inbox zero&lt;/a&gt; constantly and just recently I started organizing life and work using &lt;a href='http://orgmode.org/'&gt;org-mode&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href='http://gtdfh.branchable.com/'&gt;getting things done&lt;/a&gt;. The next step for me is to flush my head whenever possible and maybe something interesting will be produced as well.&lt;/p&gt;

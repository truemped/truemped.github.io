Compounding interest can work like magic.
It is a concept you often have in mind when talking about long-term investment strategies.
The longer your time horizon is, the more interest works for you.
Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger in action.

This is a story on compounding and how I made it work in my favor.
Not in investment (yet).
But at work.
And it is a joy to see it pay off after about 18 months.

# The little things

In our daily lives I think we often miss this.
The little things.
The countless little decisions we make along the way that can, or can not pay off in the future.
Big time.
We often, if not always, end up with mediocre results.
Compromises, and we did "[split the difference][0]".

In Tech we are occupied with endless projects.
Scrum rituals like sprints, biweekly retrospectives, demos.
But somehow we do not get what we want.

Rich Hickey comes to mind:

But it can also kill your productivity slowly and lead to disengaged teams.

_Especially_ when thinking about inefficiencies.
Why things take forever to finish.
As a response to this we often search for the big bottleneck.
"Is process x not working as expected?"
"Can we optimize process y to reduce hand-overs?"

I doubt this __one__ big thing really exists.
If it would be so obvious, someone would already have taken care of it.
Assuming no malicious intent of course.
But if this one thing does not exist, what is it?

# The little things

In my experience it is often the little things that slow you down.
Maybe a decision in this one project a year ago.
Innocent back then.
A small hack to finish the project on time.
Over time you find out that this hack morphed into a feature and it is an essential part of your product.

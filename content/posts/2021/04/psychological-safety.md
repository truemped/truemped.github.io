More and more work involves collaboration. Multiple people working in a team on
the same *thing* that is becoming ever more complex. What does this mean for an
organization? Information and knowledge, especially in the technology domain, is
becoming a commodity. All the best technical tools to build your next Google is
just a Google search away. In the age of digital products, market access is
getting cheaper every day. This increases the importance of the team and their
effectiveness as it becomes a company's unique selling point.

The way people in a team collaborate is a key competitive advantage over other
participants in the market. It is not just about *execution*. If the best
execution would be a valid concept, you could just get the best backend engineer
from A, frontend engineer from B, GraphQL service from C, and security engineer
from D. But none of this really matters. Russel Ackoff says it best:

> Performance of a system depends on how the parts interact, not on how they act
> taken separately.

# The Aluminum Company of America

[Alcoa][7] is a company founded in 1886 producing aluminum, among other things. In
1987 [Paul H. O'Neil][0] took the role of CEO and gave a famous first speech to
Wall Street investors of the then troubling company. In it, he announced he would
mainly focus his efforts towards improving worker safety. The investors where
shocked and advised their clients to sell ASAP. How would that impact the failed
product lines?

Some time after that, an 18 year old kid got killed at one of the plants. One
larger production part blocked a machine from operating and the kid decided to
jump on it in order to remove the part. Not a great idea as the kid died when
the machine started to work again. O'Neil got the whole management board on
stage at the plant declaring it was their fault and ultimately they helped
create the environment in which the kid thought that this was a good idea.

The company lost 1.87 workdays per 100 workers to work injuries in 1887. By 2012
this number reduced to 0.2 workdays. One year after this speech the company's
profits were on a record high.

# The Andon Cord

Toyota is a car company you probably know. It is famous for its high quality
cars, and in other circles for the [Toyota Way][2] and the [Toyota Production
System][3]. The Toyota Way and the Production System are the first incarnations
of what we today know as "lean": lean management, lean product management, lean
project management, lean startup. John Krafcik created the term in his article
[Triumph of the Lean Production System][4] in 1988.

One critical piece in the Production System is the *Andon Cord*. At every work
station in a production line there is a cord hanging from the top. Pulling this
cord signals an issue or problem to the colleagues and the supervisor. The key
difference is that pulling the cord is a positive act. When you pull it, you not
only raise a problem, instead you raise awareness for a potential improvement.
A chance for everyone to learn.

# Project Aristotle

In 2012 researchers working at Google started a journey. They wanted to find out
how one can build the perfect team. What are its ingredients or properties? This
is now known as project [Aristotle][1].

After analyzing 180 teams from across the company they could not identify a
pattern for the perfect team. Add more skills? The wrong personality types?
Non-matching background? What they did find was that a team of experts in each
area they operated in was just as successful as the team that seemingly had *too
much fun*.

> The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’
> teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another.[^1]
 
The one thing the researchers identified was the role of **group norms**. The
exact shape of the norms however was not important. There is such a thing as the
*perfect* group norm you can simply push to the team and everything will be
great. What is does mean is that every member of the group accepts the norms of
the group. One norm however stood out, both in the data and the psychological
research: the role of **psychological safety**.

# What is Psychological Safety?

These are just the important examples of where psychological safety had a
positive impact. This is more than just the environment in which people feel
safe to *ask questions*. The way the person asking is treated and what happens
to the question and potential answers is what defines safety.

Amy Edmondson wrote [The Fearless Organization][6] about psychological safety
and defines it as

> a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish
> someone for speaking up. It describes a team climate characterized by
> interpersonal trust and mutual respect in which people are comfortable being
> themselves.

If this is so important to successful teams the question is of course how we can
build psychological safety? This leads to building trust and vulnerability-based
trust beginning with the boss. My bookshelf is probably too small to get all
titles on building a trustful and safe environment. Besides the aforementioned
book by Amy Edmondson I want to mention the classic [Five Dysfunctions of a
Team][5].

Another interesting angle is how fragile safety really is. How even small
interactions that look innocent at first sight, can quickly destroy it. And
finally, how safety is not just about an environment where it is safe to *ask
questions*, but where those questions lead to a better team and organization.

# Destroying Psychological Safety

The most simple way to destroy safety is of course the obvious one: being the
a**hole in the room, claiming all wins for you and all defeats to others in the
team. If this person is also the boss, the situation is helpless. If you find
yourself in it, just run.

Far too often, the one raising an issue is the *trouble maker*. It is the boss's
behavior in this situation that separates success from failure. The most simple
way is to neglect and marginalize the issue. Maybe this person has raised a lot
of issues lately and never presents solutions. Why bother with yet another
*false* claim?! Not treating those occasions as what they deserve to be,
*pulling the andon cord*, is not only a missed opportunity. In the long term it
will lead to people not caring anymore. In this hypothetical example there can
be two issues really: 1/ the person is new to the team and their expectations do
not match those of the boss, and 2/ they are too junior in their role and need
more coaching and guidance. For both cases there are great insights to gain that
will make the team and organization better in the future.

Take the example of a new manager joining a team. Often times a manager joins in
order to bring knowledge and experience from organization A to organization B.
Bespoke manager can now tell everyone exactly what to do. But this misses the
point of creating an environment where people feel safe to speak up. Even if the
domain is the same, the solutions the organization came up with before are
likely different from the manager's previous gig. When joining a new
organization, the best way to create this environment is to give context to
people on how you solved the issue before, what were the constraints in this
other team, what decisions have you taken. Then ask how one would go about this
in this new organization. This transports knowledge and experience *and* invites
others to think for themselves.

# A fragile construct

Safety is a fragile construct and does not happen over night. Yet it is one of
***the*** key advantages when building successful teams. Building safety takes
time and effort, but when you were successful, when you are part of this *safe*
team, you will instantly know it and it will be a work experience to remember.
In that case: pay attention to it, don't destroy it accidentally, you might loose
your advantage.

I personally have had this experience twice in my career so far. To every single
team member I still have contact and we frequently talk to each other. Not every
week, or every month. But hardly any quarter passes by in which we don't
interact at least shortly.

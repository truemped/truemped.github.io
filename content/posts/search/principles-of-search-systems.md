## Old content

Search is a ubiquitous feature in modern technology products today. Be it the
in-app, onsite or e-commerce search; it is difficult to think those products
without a search bar. But still, there are many different levels of search
systems and experiences today. Obviously Google defined what search experience
means: a simple search bar, automatically suggested queries and the best
matching result on top.

Unfortunately it's not that easy. **Netflix** hardly understands me and what I'm
looking for. The autosuggest and instant search gives direct feedback on my
query, but I simply cannot combine any of the attributes they advertise to
search for: "*a show, movie, genre, etc***.

**Apple Music** Search fails basic user experience. Searching for the exact
title returns zero results while removing keywords finally matches the title as
the n-th position.

The question now is, what exactly defines a good search experience and search
system? How might we formalize this into principles that could define what a
great search means today?

The question is: what exactly makes them "poor"?

What is a good search experience?

What kind of principles can we derive from existing good search systems?


Search is a ubiquitous feature in modern products today. Hardly any App, site or
e-commerce shop works without Search. With so many people working on Search one
would believe this feature is a solved problem. But then you end up using some
of those Search systems and they fail to serve your basic needs.

For example on **Netflix** you can search for "*a show, movie, genre, etc*". But
don't you dare combining any of the options. Searching for "*once upon a time in
the west*" does not return the movie -- I assume it's not available -- but other
movies from the western genre. So far, so good, searching for a title returns
similar movies from the same genre.

Try searching for "*western once upon*" and you are greeted with a zero
result page. Or that documentary about Dublin you remember watching in the hotel
room on Netflix: "*dublin documentary*", also zero results.

Contrast this with **YouTube** where the autosuggest correctly completes
"*western once upon*" to "*western once upon a time in the west*". Even the
result page shows clips from that movie. At **Prime Video** the auto-suggest
fails to complete, but at least the search results contain the correct video --
as the *second* result. The Search on **Amazon** itself is rather good which
makes me wonder, why the same product in two different parts are working so
differently.

## What defines a good Search?

no surprises

be able to search for everything


## What is going wrong?

I believe different places have different trade-offs and cultures to address
challenges.

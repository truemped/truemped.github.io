We all want teams to be effective.
Not a single dime spent that does not bring value.
We keep them occupied at all times.
That is what makes an effective team and this is how they generate the most value.

That's not how it works though.

This is a recipe for disaster.
Mediocre results.
Burnout.
And high turn around.

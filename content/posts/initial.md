## Start Over

So here I am, again claiming to stick to blogging. This time I'll start with a
look back at 2018 and my New Year resolutions that will make sure 2019 will be a
blast.

Last year was a challenge for me as so many things happened that impacted my
**work-life**. I transitioned into management and became **Engineering Lead** in
the Search department at Zalando. I was surprised at how much I actually like
working with people. In my life as individual contributor I was mostly writing
code and argued about it. Now I enjoy understanding someone else's motivation,
where she is coming from and what their goals are.

I read a ton of books and blogs about transitioning. I liked
[The Manager's Path][2] by Camille Fournier. I started reading
[Managing Humans][3] and have not yet finished. I did read some old time
classics even before like [The five dysfunctions of a team][4], a book you
should probably go through every once in a while. Another great classic is
[Peopleware][5], short and concise. [Radical Candor][9] is on the top of my
reading list. Lately I've been involved in strategy topics and one great book in
this area is [Good Strategy/Bad Strategy][6] with a lot of examples for good and
bad strategy.

I signed up for the [Software Lead Weekly][7] newsletter and joined
[Rands Leadership Slack][8]. Particularly the **face to face** meetings are a
great experience as you get to speak to so many great people from all over the
world about leadership topics. Another benefit is that talking about Leadership
topics outside of one's organization brings a different, hopefully unbiased
perspective into your work.

But it came at a cost: I'm not coding anymore. There are days when I first open
my Laptop after lunch. I had to learn to manage my calendar, block time for
lunch, otherwise people will just add meetings into empty spots. Prioritization
is even more important now as just about everyone wants something from me.

## My 2019 Goals

In this year I'll be working as manager for almost a full year now. I made
mistakes and I will continue to make them but I want to learn from them.

### Keep on Coding

My job title is *Engineering* Lead. But how can I be an *Engineering Lead* when
I'm not writing code? Or not participating in Code reviews? Architecture
decisions? That does not mean I need to make all the decisions or tell people
how to write code. But I don't want to loose grip. I think it is important to
feel the pain your engineers go through. This could mean taking a 24x7 shift
every once in a while. Or fixing a bug in one of our systems.

For now I'm trying to maintain one of our Kafka Streams components written in
Clojure. I recently contributed patches to [Jackdaw][10], a Clojure wrapper for
Kafka Streams. It felt pretty good!

### Writing Habit

Since I started to work as Engineering Lead and transitioned into Management it
became apparent for me that working on and improving my writing skills is
absolutely necessary for my new job. It is almost like writing documentation for
your code: instead of talking to people individually and over and over again,
I'd like to refer them to my writing. Additionally, writing down your thoughts
should help me be more precise in my arguments and force me to think about them.

### Learn to say no

**No** is a very powerful word.

### Balance my life

Paul Adams wrote an interesting piece on
[How I try to organise my life to make me happy][0]. He has some interesting
points and formalizes what many people think. The idea originates from a speech
by [Matthew McConaughey][1] in 2015 and is about identifying the things that
matter to you and tracking the time spend doing them. Ideally there should be a
balance in all the areas in order to keep you healthy.

Identifying the things that matter to me is simple as they are exactly the same
as for Paul: Father, Husband, Family, Friend, Colleague, Me. I probably would
not go as far as mapping the results, but keeping track of them in my org-mode
files would be an even nerdier start.

I first came across [Jessica Kerr][0] in the [Greater than Code][1] podcast a few years ago.
I had just started my management career.
And had a growing feeling of: there is more to it than just the tech.
The podcast was a source of (for me) new mental models, management approaches, and how people behave.
One such model I that caught my interest was the [Viable System Model][3] (VSM) by [Stafford Beer][4].

She published a nice [article][2] about it and you should go read it first.
Because I disagree with the recursive property of the VSM she is making.
The VSM is ***not*** only recursive in system 1.
But more on this later.
First, let me give a short introduction to the model.

# Viable System Model

It has its roots in the field of complex adaptive systems.
The core insight is that the main goal of every organism is to survive.
This can be mice, human beings, or groups of people.
An insight that relates with business.
It's not about winning, but staying in the game!
Surviving.

A fundamental property of the system is being recursive.
A complex, viable system is built of other complex, viable subsystems.
Just like the organizations we work in.
The smallest viable system in a company is the individual.
Teams are built of multiple individuals.
Organizations are built of multiple teams.
And so on.

The model contains five subsystems that each have their own objective.
Every organism, or organization for that matter, can be decomposed into those five systems.

**System 1** is where work actually gets done.
The team writing code.
The construction worker building the wall.

**System 2** are the communication paths between System 1 and the *meta systems* 3, 4, and 5.
It mainly allows System 3 to observe and coordinate the daily activities in System 1.

**System 3** are the structures and controls, rights and responsibilities of System 1.
It is the main interface between System 1 and Systems 4 and 5.

**System 4** are the bodies observing the environment.
Their main purpose is to understand how the organization needs to adapt in order to remain viable.

Finally, **System 5** is responsible for policy decisions within the organization.
It weighs the different demands of parts of the organization and steers it as a whole.

Those five systems together are enough for an organism to survive.

## Debugging an organization

With all those systems and their roles in place, you can now start debugging issues in your organization.
And use it to understand where your team fits, the content of [Kerr's][2] article.
She describes the systems slightly differently.
We agree on **System 1** and **System 3**.
But **System 2** is the *support* system.
**System 3** is coherence in execution, i.e. the manager.
**System 4** is external focus, the product manager.
**System 5** is policy and it almost sounds like a team charter.



The only thing I do think she is wrong with, is the idea only "system[s] 1" are recursive.
And that all other systems must not be viable systems themselves.
Even HR and a platform team must be viable in order to survive.
They too need a system 3 to coordinate work.
System 4 to observe the environment, the needs of other viable systems in the wider organization.
And they need system 5 to balance the different aspects of the teams.

The balancing part for conflicts she described is the System 5, the one driving policy decisions.
This system needs to balance the different demands of other subsystems.

In the situation she describes with HR, System 5 is not working.
Instead of balancing the different demands, HR can do whatever they want.
The larger system fails, because there is no coherent policy in place.

In case of the platform team that should be spun off as a startup?
System 4 is failing dramatically.
It is not observing the team's environment.
Not checking what their customers need.
Instead, the system is building something for their own sake unrelated to their customers.

My current personal favorite is the time we spend in status update meetings.
There are plenty of them.
And the larger the organization, the more status meetings there seem to be.
Where is the problem?
Obviously in system 2, the communication channels.
Instead of a coherent, global update mechanism, these updates need to be delivered individually.
For every single part of the organization that needs that information.
So that those parts can plan their activities.

# Summary

Every organization is one giant viable system and it is composed of smaller viable systems.
The Viable System Model can help understand issues in any part of the organization.
This can be a small team or a large business unit.
It might not tell you directly how to fix something.
But it can be helpful to have one language and mental model to discuss those issues.

I'm an Engineering Lead with a strong background in Search and Backend
engineering. Working with [Elasticsearch][0] or [Solr/Lucene][1] is my passion
and if I get to choose the programming language it's [Clojure][2]. My third
secret passion is working with [Apache Kafka][3] and especially
[Kafka Streams][4].

Since my transition into management started I discovered my passion for working
with and for people. There is something special about helping people and teams
succeed. Find out more about me in my [Manager Readme][5].

I'm an Engineering Manager with a strong background in Search and Backend
engineering. Working with [Elasticsearch][0] or [Solr/Lucene][1] is my passion
and if I get to choose the programming language it's [Clojure][2], although I
also liked some level of Scala with Finch. Finally, my secret passion is working
with [Apache Kafka][3] and especially [KafkaStreams][4].

In 2018 I transitioned into management. What I had previously considered empty
phrases became something I value more and more. Things like "we can only win
together", e.g. I believe this to be even more relevant today. While you can win
as an individual or a very small team this does not necessarily mean winning
for the company.

If I happen to be your manager or we happen to work in the same company, please
have a look at [How to: Daniel][5]. This hopefully provides some context and
kick start our relationship.
